The Maplin Robot Arm is a 35 British Pounds robot arm that anybody can assemble in a couple of hours. In order to control the robot arm from any USB enabled device, this is the Snappy Ubuntu Core code to create a Snap that runs on X86 and ARM-based systems.

Download the project, install libusb, do
make build-go
make copy-binaries
make

Afterwards you will have your snap.
